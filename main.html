  <h2>The upside of noise&mdash;rounding, quantization and dither</h2>

  <div class="left_col">

    Say you have a ruler with only centimeter units marked, but you
    need to measure the length of a pencil (true length 7.8 cm) to an
    accuracy of 0.1 cm. If you can only round to the neasest cm value
    (e.g., 8 cm), what can you do? Perhaps counter-intuitively, you
    can add noise (often called dither).

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Consider introducing a random error, uniformly distributed on
    $[-0.5, 0.5]$ cm. If you make repeated measurements they
    will <i>mostly</i> be 8 cm (prob = 0.8) and <i>sometimes</i> 7 cm
    (prob = 0.2). On average, the result closes on 7.8 cm as the
    number of trials increases. This is illustrated in the code below
    (shift+enter after editing).

    If we measure the pencil repeatedly <i>without</i> dither the
    roundng error (often called quantization error) is the same each
    time---averaging is no help. Dither helps by randomizing the
    quantization error for each trial, so that averaging diminishes
    its effect.

    In real applications (with signals, rather than pencils)
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter
    analog-to-digital converters] (ADC) and
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter digital
    to analog converters] (DAC)&mdash;basically integer quantizers
    like the ruler above&mdash;suffer a very similar
    problem. Periodicities in quantization errors are particularly
    damaging, for instance, in mobile devices and control systems.

    As with our pencil example, dithering the measurement (that is,
    randomizing the decision of the quantizer) destroys the
    periodicity and reduces the overall harm (on average).  To make
    this idea more concrete, consider quantizing a signal that
    increases linearly with time (i.e., a ramp).

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Depending on the slope of the ramp, the quantization errors can
    exhibit various patterns (a
    [http://www.google.com/patents/US7940099 real problem] in
    radio-frequency digital phase-locked loops (PLL), where the output
    phase is a ramp that is quantized in the feedback path).
 
    The code below quantizes a ramp with a specified slope. The first
    plot shows the quantization error without dither (periodic on
    N=128 samples). The second plot (green trace) shows the
    corresponding spectrum is rich in harmonics ("spurs"). The red
    trace shows the spectrum after dither and averging (in the manner
    of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_method Welch], to
    estimate the PSD). It is instructive to change the slope, and
    other parameters, and see the effect on the spectrum (shift+enter

    Although dither adds noise to the system, the flat (and
    predictable) spectrum is greatly preferred in real-world
    applications.
